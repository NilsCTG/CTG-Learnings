# Problem Solving

## Problem solving approaches 

### What is an algorithm? 

A **process** or **set of steps** to accomplish a certain task. 

### What is problem solving all about?

1. Understand the problem.
2. Explore concrete examples.
3. Break it down.
4. Solve/simplify
5. Look back and refactor

### 1. Understand the problem

In order to determine, whether you have understood a problem, be sure you can answer the following questions: 

1. Can i restate the problem in my own words?
2. What are the inputs that go into the problem?
3. What are the outputs that should come from the solution of the problem?
4. Can the outputs be determined from the inputs? Meaning: Do I have enough information to solve the problem? 
5. How should I label the important pieces of data that are a part of the problem? 

### 2. Explore examples

- start with simple examples
- progress to more complex examples
- explore examples with empty input
- explore examples with invalid input

### 3. Break it down

- Explicitly write down the steps you need to take.
- when starting to write code, write down each step you want to implement
- this will help identifying gaps or misscoceptions in the approach

### 4. Solve/simplify

**Solve**</br>
If you can't solve a problem, solve a simplified version</br>
&rarr; try to ignore the part you cannot solve

**Simplify**
- find the core difficulty in what you're trying to do
- temporarily ignore that difficulty
- write a simplified solution
- then incorporate that difficulty back in

### 5. Look back and refactor

**Refactoring Questions:**
- Can you check the result?
- Can you derive the result differently?
- Can you understand it at a glance?
- Can you use the result or method for some other problem?
- Can you improve the solution of your problem?
- Can you think of other ways to refactor?
- How have other people solved this problem? 

## Problem solving patterns

Some patterns:
- Frequency Counter
    - uses objects or sets to collect values/frequencies of values
    - can avoid the need for nested loops or O(n<sup>2</sup>) operations with array/strings
- Multiple Pointers

- Sliding Window
- Divide and Conquer
- Dynamic Programming
- Greedy Algorithms
- Backtracking
- **Many more**
